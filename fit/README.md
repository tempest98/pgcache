# pgcache-fit

Offline "will pgcache help my workload?" analyzer. Point it at a trace of your
SQL and it tells you which statements pgcache would cache, which it would pass
through to the origin (and why), and an upper bound on the cache hit rate — all
without a running pgcache, a running database, or a schema dump.

It runs pgcache's *actual* query-analysis pipeline (cacheability, resolution,
constraint analysis, admission) against your queries, so a verdict here is the
verdict the proxy would reach. It does not connect to anything or send your
queries anywhere.

## Install

Pre-built binaries are attached to the repo's
[Releases](https://github.com/PgCache/pgcache/releases). Pick the asset for
your platform:

| Platform | Asset |
|---|---|
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `pgcache-fit-0.0.2-aarch64-apple-darwin` |
| Linux x86_64 | `pgcache-fit-0.0.2-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` |
| Linux arm64 | `pgcache-fit-0.0.2-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` |

Download it, make it executable, and run:

```sh
# with the gh CLI (macOS arm64 shown)
gh release download fit-v0.0.2 --repo PgCache/pgcache \
  --pattern 'pgcache-fit-0.0.2-aarch64-apple-darwin'

# or with curl
curl -LO https://github.com/PgCache/pgcache/releases/download/fit-v0.0.2/pgcache-fit-0.0.2-aarch64-apple-darwin

chmod +x pgcache-fit-0.0.2-*
./pgcache-fit-0.0.2-aarch64-apple-darwin check queries.sql
```

The Linux binaries are static (musl) and run on any distro with no
dependencies. macOS binaries are unsigned; running from the terminal after
`chmod` normally works — only if macOS refuses with "cannot be verified",
clear the quarantine flag: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ./pgcache-fit-*`.

Verify a download against the release's `SHA256SUMS`:

```sh
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS   # Linux; on macOS: shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS
```

## Build from source

pgcache-fit is a member of the pgcache workspace:

```sh
cargo build --release -p pgcache-fit
# binary at ../target/release/pgcache-fit
```

## Browser build

`fit/wasm/` wraps the same library in a WebAssembly bundle for the site's
in-browser analyzer (one JSON request in, one JSON response out; the calling
convention is in `fit/wasm/smoke.mjs`). It needs the emscripten toolchain and a
libclang built with the WebAssembly target; `fit/wasm/build.sh` resolves the
machine-specific paths, builds, copies the bundle into `site/static/fit/`, and
runs the node smoke test:

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-emscripten
fit/wasm/build.sh          # release; `debug` for an unoptimized build
```

## Usage

```sh
pgcache-fit check   <trace>   # classify statements: cacheable / passthrough / write
pgcache-fit hitrate <trace>   # [experimental] ceiling on the cache hit rate
```

Both accept `--json` for machine-readable output and `--format <fmt>` to
override input auto-detection.

### `check`

```
$ pgcache-fit check queries.sql
pgcache-fit check — 6 statements

Cacheable:   3 statements (50.0%)
Passthrough: 2 statements (33.3%)
  unsupported FROM clause         1 (16.7%)
  non-immutable function          1 (16.7%)
Writes:      1 statements (16.7%)

Write mix by table:
  users                           1 statement

Shapes: 6 distinct statements → 3 fingerprints → 3 shapes

Assumptions (schema-less mode):
  ...
```

Percentages are of statements. When the input carries call counts
(pg_stat_statements), each line also shows the share of calls, and of
execution time when that column is present:

```
Cacheable:   3 statements (50.0%)   calls  71.9%  time  31.5%
```

- **Cacheable** — pgcache would cache this SELECT.
- **Passthrough** — a SELECT pgcache would forward to the origin, grouped by
  reason (unsupported construct, non-immutable function, system-catalog
  reference, and so on).
- **Writes** — INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE, with a per-table breakdown. In the proxy
  these drive cache invalidation; here they're only counted.
- **Shapes** — how the distinct statements collapse into fingerprints (the
  cache key, per literal) and query shapes. Fewer shapes means better cache
  density. Subsumption (one cached query serving several) depends on arrival
  order, so it is reported by `hitrate`, not here.

`--statements` appends every statement, grouped by verdict: cacheable,
passthrough by reason, writes by table, and utility. Conversion failures carry
the converter's detail line:

```
Passthrough statements:

non-immutable function: 1 statement (16.7%)   calls   3.0%  time  61.6%
  [50 calls, 900.0 ms] SELECT * FROM events WHERE created_at > now()

unsupported construct (conversion): 2 statements (33.3%)
  SELECT a, b FROM t GROUP BY GROUPING SETS ((a), (b))
    Unsupported feature: GROUP BY expression
  SELECT * FROM t TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM (10)
    Unsupported SELECT feature: FROM clause type
```

Within a group, statements are ordered by time when the input has it, else by
calls, else by how often they occur (`[3×]`).

`--json` emits the same per-statement list under `verdicts`: one entry per
distinct statement with its verdict, reason, detail, write target, and
aggregate `occurrences`, `calls`, and `time_ms`.

### `hitrate` (experimental)

Replays the trace *in arrival order* against an infinite cache and reports the
ceiling on cacheable hit rate. The replay itself is faithful — it runs
pgcache's real serve-time decision (admission threshold, LIMIT sufficiency,
subsumption, the in-transaction gate) — but it does **not** yet model
write-driven invalidation, which is the dominant effect on a real hit rate.
Read the number as a ceiling, and expect it to change once invalidation
simulation lands.

```
$ pgcache-fit hitrate queries.sql
pgcache-fit hitrate [experimental] — 6 statements, 6 calls

Writes:        1 calls (invalidation not simulated — future mode)
Utility:       0 calls
Non-cacheable: 2 calls
Cacheable:     3 calls
  hits              0
  subsumption hits  0
  cold misses       3

Hit rate: 0.0% of cacheable SELECTs / 0.0% of all SELECTs / 0.0% of all statements
```

`--admission-threshold N` matches pgcache's `admission_threshold`: a query
isn't registered (and so is forwarded) until its Nth sighting. Default 1
(register on first sight).

Because invalidation isn't simulated, a "hit" here is a hit only if nothing
wrote to the underlying tables in between — so the ceiling is tight for a
read-heavy workload and increasingly optimistic the more you write to cached
tables. Ordering matters, so `hitrate` needs a real trace (a `.sql` script or
a log) — it rejects `pg_stat_statements` input, which is pre-normalized and has
no arrival order.

## Capturing a trace

pgcache-fit auto-detects four input formats.

**Plain SQL** (`.sql`) — one or more statements, semicolon-separated. Good for a
quick check of a handful of queries.

**pg_stat_statements** (CSV, `check` only) — a snapshot of the queries your
database has actually run. Statements are already normalized to `$1, $2, …`,
which is exactly the shape `check` reasons about:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_stat_statements;  -- once, then let it accumulate
\copy (SELECT query, calls FROM pg_stat_statements) TO 'workload.csv' WITH CSV HEADER
```

**PostgreSQL csvlog** — a real trace with arrival order, usable by both
subcommands. Turn on statement logging (a session, or `postgresql.conf` +
reload):

```
log_destination = 'csvlog'
logging_collector = on
log_statement = 'all'        # or: log_min_duration_statement = 0
```

Then feed the `*.csv` file from your log directory to pgcache-fit.

**PostgreSQL stderr log** (best-effort) — if you already have `log_statement`
output going to a stderr-format logfile, pgcache-fit can parse `statement:` /
`execute` lines from it. csvlog is more reliable; prefer it when you can.

## Schema-less mode (and its caveats)

pgcache-fit does not read your schema. It synthesizes a catalog from the query
corpus itself, so every report ends with an explicit assumptions block:

- every table is assumed to have a primary key;
- every relation is assumed to be a table (views can't be told apart without a
  schema);
- unqualified names are assumed to be in schema `public`;
- enum/composite types aren't detectable;
- function volatility comes from a builtin PostgreSQL snapshot — unknown
  (extension or user-defined) functions are treated as non-immutable, i.e.
  passthrough;
- column types are inferred from literal comparisons where possible.

These assumptions are conservative in pgcache's favor for a couple of them
(notably the primary-key assumption — pgcache only caches tables that have a
PK), so treat the cacheable percentage as optimistic where your tables lack
PKs or where "tables" are really views.

## Not simulated yet (planned)

- write-driven cache invalidation (hitrate is an infinite-cache upper bound);
- schema-dump input (`--schema`) and live-database catalogs;
