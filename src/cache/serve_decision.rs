//! The pure serve-time decision (PGC-392): given a snapshot of a
//! fingerprint's cache entry and the request, decide whether to serve from
//! cache, forward, coalesce on an in-flight population, or ask the writer to
//! admit. Dispatch applies the decision under its write guard by re-deciding
//! from the guarded state; pgcache-fit replays the same function offline.
//!
//! Memo and MV selection are serve *backends* for a [`ServeDecision::Hit`],
//! not part of this decision. Coalescing has no offline analogue (population
//! completes instantly without a time axis), so fit never observes `Loading`.
