//! Sub-linear per-relation constraint-containment index.
//!
//! Indexes entries (keyed by an id type `K`) by their per-table constraints,
//! and answers "which entries' constraints could contain a given query's
//! constraints" sub-linearly. Subsumption candidate lookup is the first
//! consumer (replacing the linear scan over `UpdateQueries.queries` previously
//! done by `subsumption_check`); see PGC-119 for V0 and PGC-129 for V1.
//!
//! For each table, entries are partitioned by their constraint-column set
//! ([`classify`]). Within a class, equality-pure entries are hash-indexed by
//! the joint value tuple. Entries with any non-equality constraint go to a
//! `ComplexIndex` ([`column_index`]): one `ColumnIndex` per class column, each
//! partitioning entries by constraint shape. [`index`] carries the operations.
//!
//! Lookup is **lossy-safe**: missed containment opportunities just mean we
//! populate from origin instead of stamping existing rows.
